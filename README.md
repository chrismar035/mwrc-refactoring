This repo represents my excercise of following along with [@jpignata's
refactoring talk at Mountain West Ruby
Conf](http://tx.pignata.com/2013/04/mwrc-code-smells-talk.html).

He also has the code on [github](https://github.com/jpignata/mwrc), but gemified
and all nice.

This is a great talk and I strongly encourage anyone to follow along like I did!

Enjoy!
